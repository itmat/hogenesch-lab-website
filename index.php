Our laboratory studies the mammalian circadian clock using genomic and 
computational tools.  We use these tools to discover new clock genes, 
learn how the clock keeps time, and how it coordinates rhythms in 
physiology and behavior.  This clock research drives development of 
genomic and computational methods that we apply to other areas of 
biology.  Finally, we recognize biological complexity and conduct this 
research at the network, rather than single gene, level.
